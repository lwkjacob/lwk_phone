-- Transfer bridge (server): reading what another phone script left behind in the database, so a
-- server that switches to this phone keeps everyone's number, contacts, conversations, call history,
-- photos and notes. The other phone does not have to be running (it should not be): only its tables
-- have to still be there. They are read and never changed.
--
-- Each phone below is a "reader" written from that phone's own table definitions:
--   NPWD      github.com/project-error/npwd, import.sql
--   GCPhone   github.com/N3MTV/gcphone, base.sql
--
-- A reader answers in one neutral shape, with phone numbers exactly as the old phone stored them:
--   detect             a table only that phone has
--   contacts(id)       { { name, number } }
--   notes(id)          { { title, body } }
--   photos(id)         { url }
--   threads(id, num)   { { key, name?, members = { number }, msgs = { { from, text, at } } } }   oldest message first
--   calls(id, num)     { { key, caller, callee, at, duration, answered, hidden } }
-- `id` is the character (citizenid / ESX identifier), `num` their old number, `at` is seconds since 1970,
-- `key` names the thread or call the same way whichever of its two sides asks, so nothing is brought over twice.
-- Only free phones are covered, by the project owner's decision: no paid phone is read here.
-- To add another free one: add a reader below. server/transfer.lua does the rest.
